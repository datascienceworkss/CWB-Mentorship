# CWB-Mentorship
#### Code; Without Barriers is an initiative aimed at promoting diversity and inclusion in the tech industry, particularly in cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) fields. It provides training, networking opportunities, mentorship, and support to female developers, creators, and tech entrepreneurs.

Hello everyone, welcome to **CWB Mentorship program**. Throughout the program, I will be uploading slides and notebooks for each module that we'll be covering. 
For every module, you can expect:
- **1 Notebook**: This will contain the hands-on exercises and coding examples weâ€™ll be working through.
- **1 Slide Deck**: This will provide theoretical insights, key concepts, and visual aids to enhance your learning experience.

These materials are designed to work together to provide a comprehensive and engaging educational experience. Feel free to utilise these slides and notebooks for your learnings.
